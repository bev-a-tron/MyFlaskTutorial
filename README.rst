This is a Flask tutorial for people who don't know any web programming.

I started learning Flask on June 4th, 2012.  I was unhappy with the Flaskr tutorial, probably because I don't have a web programming background.  I am writing this tutorial for people like me.

You should go through the tutorial in the following order:

- start.rst
- settingup.rst
- connecting.rst
- requests.rst
- linking.rst
- nextquestion.rst
- finale.rst
- wrapup.rst
